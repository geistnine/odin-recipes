        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Dry your canned chickpeas and set them in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Peel the shells if you prefer. Coat chickpeas with
                your seasonings, salt and pepper. Set on baking sheet and
                roast at 400F for 27 to 30 minutes or until crisp.
            </li>
            <li>Meanwhile, prepare your chosen dressings by chopping the cabbage,
                onion, avocado and lime. Set aside to garnish tacos later.
            </li>
            <li>When chickpeas are almost done, heat a saute pan until ripping hot
                and warm your tortillas on it.
            </li>
            <li>When the chickpeas are done, assemble by adding chickpeas to the
                tortillas, and top with your prepared dressings.
            </li>
        </ol>
